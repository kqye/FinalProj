This is a Windows Form Application of an Ordering System in a Cafe entitled Daily Drip. This application asks for a Login for users who have an account and Sign Up for users who don't have an account. Once they have completed the Login/SignUp, they will be directed to the menu display that will prompt their desired orders and purchased items. The total amount, subtotal, tax and change will be displayed. Also a receipt can be generated if the user would like to, as this will show a more detailed summary of the orders. This app was designed to create a time-saving and user-friendly app for users or businesses in a Cafe.
